Forum will be the main place of discussion on this website. Here, users can
start new threads and comment on posts. Upvote/downvote system will most 
likely be implemented in the future. Each post is actually a table element, 
which contains the username of the user who started the thread, first couple of
words of the post (so users can understand what it is about), number of replies
and number of views. User's profile picture could be seen as well.
